## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

  - Organizing saved tracks by playlists
  - Being able to follow friends and artists alike

My Future App
Title: Depquo
Function: Serve as a sort of tree of questions that one can flow through in an endless search for compounding/related questions and answers. Need to know why blood is said to not be red until it is exposed to oxygen? Well, your initial search will give you the answer you desire and will also seemlessly provide the option to transition into an assortment of other related questions, phenomenaes, subjects, etc or allow you to delve deeper into the current subject. Customizable music themes allow the user to personalize their deep search.



## Notes

Challenges while building the app:
- The biggest challenge I encountered while designing the app was getting used to the XCode editor itself. I have not worked with an editor that allows for a simulation to be ran.
